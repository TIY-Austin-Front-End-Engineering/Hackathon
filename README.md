# April 7th Group Project

## Description
No developer or designer works in a vacuum. We all need to collaborate with teammates in our day to day work. Working effectively in a team is not as easy as it sounds, but like everything else, it just takes some practice. Over the next four days you will work in groups to build **best of** a web application. This is an excellent opportunity to build out a great portfolio piece, become more comfortable with git branching and merging, and work in a team!


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should…

* Increase your experience working in development/design teams
* Have a solid, tested, stable potential portfolio piece
* Gain confidence having together using branching/merging

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

* Backbone Router, Models and Collections
* Sass

## Details

You'll be creating a "best of" app for something of your group's choosing (ie. "Best Tacos in Austin", "Best Hiking Spots in the US", "Best Horror Movies").  Explorer mode lists the minimum requirements, but you and your team can develop features that aren't on this list.

### Deliverables

* Two repositories, one for your Frontend code and one for your Backend code:
	* Your backend repo should have a README that links to all of the other deliverables
* User stories in Trello
* A live working web application on heroku / surge (online!)

### Requirements

* Everyone
	1. ** Everyone must be a contributor on the repo with at least 5 commits **
	1. Use branching and pull requests to accomplish requirement 1
	1. Multi-device friendly (responsive)
	1. A polished presentation
	1. ** Your app must be submitted by 1am Monday morning ** so that you are ready to present by 9am Monday.
* Design
	1. Find 3 websites to inspire the design/layout/functionality of your app
	1. Sketches for 3 pages (small and large screen size)
	1. Wireframes for 3 pages (small and large screen size)
	1. 3 Style Tiles (in Illustrator)
	1. Mockups in Illustrator for home page with 1 breakpoint (small and large screen sizes), remaining pages will be rapidly prototyped
	1. Build HTML/Sass (must be responsive, must have 2 breakpoints, must use a grid system)
	1. Compatible on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox (download them if you haven’t already)
	1. Ability to defend design decisions
* Front-end
	1. Backbone Views, Models and Collections
	1. Use of AJAX (jQuery or Backbone)
* Rails
	1. Multiple models
	1. UML diagrams
	1. [A Documented API with examples and response data](https://bocoup.com/weblog/documenting-your-api)
	1. Consistent JSON response
	1. Appropriate status codes
	1. Database **and** model level validations
	1. Controllers must have minimal duplication


## Explorer Mode

Users should be able to:
- View a sorted list of the "best" items on your site
- Submit new suggestions for a "best" item
- Vote for a "best" item (there is no requirement to limit votes per person)

To begin, one frontend member of your team should create a new repo using Jess's basic webpack setup. The frontender should [invite all of your team members as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) so that they can push to the repo. Other frontend and design students should pull (don't fork) the newly created repository onto their computer and `cd` into the directory where the repo lives. Then run the `npm install` command (this could take a while to finish so I recommend that you do it as early as possible).

The designers will need to:
- npm install -g webpack
- npm install -g webpack-dev-server

The backend student(s) will create an entitely separate repository.

###Adventure Mode
- Users should be able to search or Filter "best" items
- Pagination for "best" items
- Users should be able to keep track of items they would like to try
- Restrict so more than one person cannot submit the same item

###Epic Mode 
- Users can only vote for one "best" item once
- Users can find like-minded users by displaying all users who have liked the same items they have
