# September 24th Hackathon

## Description
No developer or designer works in a vacuum. We all need to collaborate with teammates in our day to day work. Working effectively in a team is not as easy as it sounds, but like everything else, it just takes some practice. Over the next four days you will form groups and build out a web application of your choice. This is an excellent opportunity to build out a great portfolio piece, become more comfortable with git branching and merging, and finally - pitch your ideas!


## Objectives

## Normal Mode
To begin, one frontend member of your team should create a new repo using the `tiyfe` command and invite your other team members as and [invite all of your team members as collaborators](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/) so that they can push to the repo. The other frontend student and the design student should pull (don't fork) the newly created repository onto their computer and `cd` into the directory where the repo lives. Then run the `npm install` command (this could take a while to finish so I recommend that you do it as early as possible).

The backend student(s) will create an entitely separate repository.
